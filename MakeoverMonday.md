### What the data visualization shows
This visualization shows the yearly count of fatalities in school active shooter incidents, with taller bars indicating higher death tolls. Dark red bars mark years with the deadliest events, such as Sandy Hook, Parkland, and Uvalde, while gray bars represent other years. The height and color intensity make it easy to spot years with significant spikes in fatalities. The layout emphasizes patterns over time, with noticeable increases in recent decades.

### Motivation to choose this data viz
This visualization serves as a powerful reminder of the real, devastating impact of school shootings over the years. The way it highlights certain years in dark red makes the worst incidents stand out, and seeing those tall bars lined up really drives home how frequent and tragic these events have become. This visual makes it impossible to ignore the scale of the problem and reinforces just how urgent it is to address school safety and gun violence. It’s more than just data; it’s a call to pay attention.

## Step two: critique the data visualization

### My critique about the data viz
The thing that stood out to me was the use of red and labels to emphasis major tragic events. It is used along with grey so your attention will immediately shift towards the red which is major single fatality events. One of the things working well is the graph is equally split in both the x-axis and y-axis so the bars are accurate when compared relative to each other. The grey text is a good inclusion to provide additional context that the gunman is not included. Some things that don't work very well is the title or graph have no mention if the attacks are based on a particular country or a specific country so extra research is needed for the same. There is also no legend to signify what the red means and a specific label is in bold without any specific mention. One of the things I would do differently is shift the axis to the left. I would also try experimenting with a line graph to see if there is a trend and indicate the countries on which it is focused.

### Primary audience for the visualization
The data shown in this graph is for policymakers. For policymakers, these high-fatality incidents alone are enough to stress the urgent need for preventive measures to enhance school safety. For policymakers, this visualization falls short because it only shows the deadliest incidents without giving context on the overall frequency or trends in school shootings. While the major tragedies are highlighted, policymakers need to see if these incidents are happening more often, which types of schools are affected, or if certain areas are at higher risk.  This limits the visualization’s value for making informed, preventive decisions.

   
### Evaluating Stephen Few’s “Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile”
The visualization scores moderately in usefulness (6/10) by highlighting key fatality incidents but lacks broader context for fully informed decisions. Completeness (5/10) is limited as it omits data on frequency, school type, and geography, leaving an incomplete view. Perceptibility (8/10) is strong, with clear readability, though a legend would enhance clarity. Truthfulness (9/10) is high as it accurately represents fatalities but risks incomplete interpretations due to missing context. Intuitiveness (8/10) is good, being easy to interpret, though a legend would help newcomers. The aesthetics (7/10) are clean but would benefit from color variation to better emphasize severity. Engagement (3/10) is restricted by the lack of a trend or interactive elements. The evaluation method works pretty well overall, but it could really benefit from adding measures for contextual depth and interactivity. Including a color gradient would help distinguish more severe incidents at a glance. Also, a line chart showing the frequency of shootings each year would give viewers a better sense of the overall trends, not just the worst events or a bar chart with wounds and deaths. These changes would make the visualization more complete and give people the bigger picture, making it easier for them to understand trends and patterns that might not be obvious otherwise.

## Step three: sketch out a solution

### Sketching solution
In my redesign sketches (data not accurate), I focused on making the data easier to understand and adding context to show the full impact of school shootings. For the first chart, I used a bar graph that separates fatalities (red) and injuries (blue) for each year, with a clear legend to explain the colors. This approach gives a more complete picture by showing both deaths and non-fatal injuries, so viewers can see the total number of people affected each year, not just those who lost their lives. The stacked bars make it visually straightforward to compare years and understand how incidents vary in impact.

For the second chart, I switched to a line graph that only tracks deaths over time, which makes trends more apparent. This simpler format highlights increases and decreases in fatalities, helping viewers easily spot any patterns without the clutter of extra data. The line chart aligns with the critique’s idea of showing trends to see if fatalities are becoming more or less common, adding useful context. These redesigns make the information clearer and more accessible, giving a fuller, more nuanced view of the data and helping audiences grasp both the immediate impact of each incident and the longer-term trends.

## Step four: Test the solution

### User 1 feedback (Male Student, early 20's)
The sketches provide a strong starting point for visualizing data on school shootings in the USA, and many resonate with the intended audience, like law enforcement and teachers. The line chart in Sketch 1 stands out as especially effective, making it easy to see the trend in fatalities over time, which helps communicate the severity of the issue. However there are some areas for improvement—while the multi-bar chart in Sketch 2 shows both wounded and killed, it’s harder to spot unusual spikes or dips, which makes the story less clear. The reviewer felt that combining the two charts or showing the total incidents might make it easier to follow, allowing viewers to understand both trends in one glance. There was also a lack of clarity in understanding which policymakers should be targeted as each state has different laws. 

### User 2 feedback (Female Student, early 20's)
The visualizations do a great job of laying out the data on school shootings, but there are a few tweaks that could make it even more impactful and intuitive. Since blue tends to be seen as a positive color, it might be worth experimenting with a different color for fatalities, like red or dark grey, to make the severity of the numbers stand out. The line chart approach works for showing trends, so it could be beneficial to keep that style for both fatalities and wounded—perhaps as two separate lines or a combined chart. This could make the connection between the two clearer and more intuitive for the viewer. For added impact, especially if recent years have high numbers, consider using a map to show geographic distribution, which would add another layer of context.

## Step five: Build your solution

The story here has the same goal as the original—showing the impact of gun violence and urging policymakers to take action. The redesign, however, shifts the focus to reveal a disturbing trend: school shootings are not just isolated tragedies but a steadily growing crisis. The first chart makes this clear, showing a sharp rise in incidents over time, making it hard to ignore the urgency. Then, the map takes it a step further, breaking down the numbers by state, so policymakers can see exactly where their state stands. This approach not only highlights the national escalation but also brings the issue closer to home, encouraging targeted action at the state level. Together, these visuals create a fuller, more compelling call for change.
