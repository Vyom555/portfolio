## Outline

### High-Level Summary

This project investigates the patterns and trends behind airplane delays across different routes and airlines. It examines historical flight data to uncover what really causes delays, why they happen, and how things could be improved to make flying less frustrating. As someone who loves traveling but dreads the unpredictability of delays, I’m personally driven to understand the reasons behind them and find ways to make air travel smoother for everyone.

Using clear and engaging data visualizations, this project will highlight key takeaways, like when delays are most common, which airlines and airports are impacted the most, and how factors like weather and staffing play a role. The goal is simple: to help travelers like me plan better and reduce stress while sparking ideas for airlines and airports to improve operations and make flying a better experience for everyone.

### Project Structure

- Introduction: The Frustration of Flight Delays
  
Air travel is exciting until your flight gets delayed. For me, there’s nothing worse than being stuck at the airport, frustrated and helpless. That’s why I’ve always been curious about what causes these delays and how we can make the experience better for everyone.

- Background: Why Understanding Delays Matters
  
Flight delays aren’t just an inconvenience; they affect millions of people and cost airlines and passengers both time and money. I want to dive into the common causes—like weather, staffing, and scheduling issues—and figure out why they happen so often.

- Data Analysis: What the Numbers Tell Us
  
This is where the data is dug into to find patterns and trends. When are delays most likely to happen? Which airlines and routes are hit the hardest? Are there certain times of the year or conditions that make delays worse? The goal is to uncover trends that can help explain the chaos.

- Visual Storytelling: Making the Data Speak
  
The data will use clear visuals to bring the data to life. Whether it’s charts showing the worst airports for delays or graphs of seasonal trends, the data will attempt to make it easy to understand what’s going on.

- Solutions/Call to Action: Making Flying Better

What can airlines do to improve? How can passengers plan smarter? This section will focus on practical steps to reduce the impact of delays, from operational fixes to tips for travelers who want to avoid surprises.

### User Stories

As an air traveler, I want to understand the causes and patterns of airport delays so that I can plan my trips better and minimize frustration.

I can do this by identifying the common reasons for delays, the most affected airports and airlines, and recommending strategies to airplane companies to reduce their impact on my travel experience.

### Summary

Frequent airport delays disrupt travel plans and frustrate passengers.

### Initial Sketches

### The data
The data for this project comes from the Flight Delay and Cancellation Dataset (2019–2023), available on Kaggle. This dataset provides detailed information about flight delays, cancellations, airlines, airports, and specific reasons for disruptions, such as carrier issues, weather conditions, and late aircraft. By leveraging this data, the project will analyze patterns and trends to uncover insights about when and why delays occur, which airlines and routes are most impacted, and how these factors affect passengers and operations.

This dataset will help identify key delay causes and measure their impact across various dimensions, such as cities, time of year, and flight routes. It will allow the project to correlate delay durations with specific factors and identify trends over time, helping to provide actionable insights for travelers and airlines to improve planning and efficiency.

### Method and medium
I will use Tableau to create detailed and visually engaging data visualizations. To present and tell the story, I will be using Shorthand.
