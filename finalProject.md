## Outline

### High-Level Summary
This project investigates the patterns and trends behind airplane delays across different routes and airlines. It examines historical flight data to uncover what really causes delays, why they happen, and how things could be improved to make flying less frustrating. As someone who loves traveling but dreads the unpredictability of delays, Iâ€™m personally driven to understand the reasons behind them and find ways to make air travel smoother for everyone.

Using clear and engaging data visualizations, this project will highlight key takeaways, like when delays are most common, which airlines and airports are impacted the most, and how factors like weather and staffing play a role. The goal is simple: to help travelers like me plan better and reduce stress while sparking ideas for airlines and airports to improve operations and make flying a better experience for everyone.
