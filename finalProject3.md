# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II

Since the completion of Part II, changes were primarily made better to align the story with the target audience of travelers. The context of why flights are delayed was removed to maintain focus on actionable insights for travelers rather than address airline operations. This layout was adjusted to prioritize clarity, placing graphs at the top and accompanying text below, which improved the readability and interpretation of the visual data.

Color palettes were added to the horizontal bar chart to clearly distinguish the best and worst airlines, making the information more intuitive for the audience. The title of the graphs were also modified to convey the inference to be made effectively. Additionally, the CTA was modified to directly target travelers, offering practical advice tailored to varying urgency levels such as for urgent travel, one should look for less delayed airlines and cities, while if time is not of importance less commute time to the airport and cost-effective options would be preferred. These changes ensure that the content remains engaging, user-focused, and actionable.

## The audience

The final data story focuses on travelers, based on insights from interviews that involved travelers rather than airport staff. To better target this audience, I removed the heatmap explaining reasons for delays and shifted the emphasis to practical details, like where delays occur and which flights are most impacted. This adjustment ensures the story delivers relevant and actionable insights, making it more useful for helping travelers plan better and minimize disruptions.

# Final thoughts

Looking back on the project, I liked how it evolved to focus directly on the needs of travelers. The interviews were key in identifying what the target audience would like to know. What stood out to me was how small changes, like modifying the graph layout and having eye-catching titles, made the story much more attention-grabbing and easy to comprehend. Aligning the project with real user feedback was a major step up, and it showed the value of iterative improvements and listening to the audience.

On a personal level, this project resonated because Iâ€™ve experienced the frustrations of flight delays myself. That connection drove me to create a story that I hope genuinely helps travelers. It also improved my skill in presenting complex data clearly and meaningfully. This project showed me how powerful data storytelling can be and the proper way to present data and tell a story.
