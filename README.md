Portfolio for Telling Stories With Data 

# About me
Hi! I’m Vyom Shah (he/him), currently studying for a Master of Information Systems Management at Carnegie Mellon University. I’m passionate about software development and product management, especially when building solutions that make a real impact and are easy to use. I’ve worked on a range of projects, from developing software applications to enhancing user interfaces and implementing machine learning models.

I’m always curious and love diving into new challenges, whether it’s creating interactive user interfaces or designing backend integrations. I thrive in collaborative settings and am excited about joining teams where I can learn, contribute, and grow.

# What I hope to learn
I’m hoping to get better at turning complex numbers into clear, relatable stories. I want to learn how to create visualizations that make data easy to understand and meaningful, so I can share insights in a way that genuinely connects with others.
