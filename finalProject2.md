| Lack of data on specific delay trends, such as weekend vs. weekday delays. | Include graphs or visualizations analyzing delays by day of the week. |
| The legend that depicted the size in the U.S. map was unnecessary | Remove the size legend from the map. | 
| The story resonates but needs a better transition in between sections. | Try to add a connection between section to join all the dots of the story. |
